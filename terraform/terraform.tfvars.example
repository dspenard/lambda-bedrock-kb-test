# Terraform Variables Example File
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values

# Optional 3-character prefix for resource names
# Common uses: developer initials (dts, sm, ak) or environment names (dev, stg, prd)
# Leave empty or comment out for no prefix (default behavior)
# resource_prefix = "dts"  # Developer initials example
# resource_prefix = "dev"  # Environment name example
# resource_prefix = ""     # No prefix (default)

# Knowledge Base Configuration
# By default, knowledge base is ENABLED with Terraform-managed S3 bucket
# To disable knowledge base deployment, uncomment the line below:
# enable_knowledge_base = false

# Frontend Configuration (API Gateway + Cognito)
# By default, frontend is ENABLED for browser-based access with authentication
# To disable frontend and use backend-only testing via AWS CLI, uncomment the line below:
# enable_frontend = false

# Option 2: Use existing S3 bucket (for legacy deployments)
# This is automatically set by the setup-knowledge-base-s3.sh script
# Do not set this manually unless you have an existing bucket
# knowledge_base_bucket_name = "dts-bedrock-kb-a1b2c3d4"

# OpenSearch Access Configuration
# Include current AWS user in OpenSearch access policy (useful for manual operations)
# Set to false in production environments for better security
# include_current_user_in_opensearch_access = true  # Default: true

# AWS region (optional - defaults to us-east-1)
# aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Project name (optional - defaults to bedrock-agent-testbed)
# Only change this if you want a completely different project name
# project_name = "bedrock-agent-testbed"
